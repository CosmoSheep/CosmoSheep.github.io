title: "Nanjing"
description: "Nanjing, where I used to live for 4 years, is a city with a long history and brilliant past. Being capital of six ancient dynasties of China contributes to its cultural prosperity while the history of Nanjing Massacre in 1937 adds a touch of sadness to it. As a college student, I used to indulge myself in the beauty of this amazing city -- cherry blossoms in early spring, fireflies during midsummer, the golden morning with flaming maple leaves in late autumn and winter snow on the riverside of Qinhuai. I graduated from NJU and left Nanjing in the summer of 2018, while some characters of this city had been integrated into a part of myself. Luckily, I had always been looking for and capturing beauty in the golden city during the four years. Here they are, the city and my beloved Nanjing University."
