user_description: I am a Presidential Fellow and fifth-year graduate student at <a target="_blank" href="https://ccapp.osu.edu">The Ohio State University, Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP)</a>. I work with <a target="_blank" href="https://hirata10.github.io">Prof. Christopher Hirata</a> on a variety of topics in cosmology and astrophysics to study the structure, composition and evolution of the Universe and help the precision measurements of it. I received my B.S. at Physics in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/">Nanjing University</a>. In leisure time, I am enthusiastic about photography, stargazing, cooking spicy food and petting my sweet little cat <a target="_blank", href="/gallery/Batian/">Batian (霸天)</a>.
